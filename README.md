# **Astifa Game GUI Implementation**

## **Overview**

It is a coursework for my university. The theme was make a competitive game with multiplayer. A 2D multiplayer game featuring real-time character control, animations, and interactions. Built with **C++**, **SFML**, and **Windows Forms**, this project showcases client-server communication and engaging GUI design.

## **Features**

- **Player Characters**: Unique movements and animations.
- **Physics**: Jumping, double-jumps, attacking, and gravity.
- **Sound Effects**: Background music and effects for interactions.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Real-time data exchange with TCP sockets.
- **Interactive GUI**: Windows Forms for player selection and game interaction.
